Browserstack tunnel
===================

A docker image to run the [Browserstack](http://www.browserstack.com/) local tunnel.

To achieve a reliable connection, running the container with `--net host` is advised.

The container expects a KEY environment variable with the Browserstack key, and can take an ARGS environment variable to pass additional arguments to the tunnel binary.
